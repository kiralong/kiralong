### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am a Data Scientist in the Center for Conservation Genomics at the Smithsonian National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. I specialize in tropical ornithology, population genomics, and conservation genomics. I'm a biologist and bioinformatician.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning additional data analyses for whole genome data, GWAS, GTseq data, and workflows like Nextflow and Snakemake for conservation applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on biology and conservation projects! Especially on tropical birds.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning better coding practices to bring into biology and making coding accessible to biologists at various skill levels.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about birds, field biology, hybridization, and population genomic data.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact me through my [Smithsonian profile](https://profiles.si.edu/display/nLongK10222024)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
